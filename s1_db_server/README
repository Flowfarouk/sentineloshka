These codes are to be run from the Sentinel-1 database server.

The idea is that this server will get list of all files from a MySQL database
(structure based on LiCS database - ask COMET if you cannot arrange your own J)
that are overlapping given bounding box.

Then these files will be preprocessed by ISCE (reading, selecting bursts, calibrating based on aux files) and sent to
s1_proc_server for further processing.

Of course both servers can be the same - I had some reasons to separate it..

The processing chain is started using script sentineloshka_make_it.sh
Please, take a look at files in templates folder. They include paths to orbital and auxiliary data directory for Sentinel-1
